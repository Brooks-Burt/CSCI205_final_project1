## Project Information
This project tries to simulate population growth within specific species. It works by taking in a desired amount of both predators and prey and then generating food across the board. By tying reproduction of each animal to their eating of either prey if they are a predator, or food if they are prey, the user can view the growth of both populations over time, and the decrease as they run out of energy and are removed from the board.

## How to run it
The program requires that you create a configuration for the Simulator module. This can be done using "run -PmainClass=main.Simulator". When running this configureation, the GUI with pop up with two sliders that determine the total number of predators and prey. You must set the sldiers first to the desired number of prey and predators. Then you will click generate to set that number of prey and predators to the screen. After that you must click start to begin running the program and then prey (black), predators (red), and food (green), will appear on the screen and begin to move. When the program finishes running all of the objects will disappear from the GUI. If you wish to run it again, you must close out the GUI and run the simulator a second time. There have been slight issues when large numbers of prey and predators are chosen, but for small numbers issues are minimal.
